#
# JIRA accepts attachments from users and as such, when showing those attachments to other users, risks a form of
# security breach known as a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attack. Hostile users (or their compromised accounts) who can
# upload an attachment could be able to acquire access to JIRA on behalf of another user (such as an administrator)
# with a specially crafted attachment. Internet Explorer ignores the Content-Type header sent by a server
# to indicate whether or not a file is text/html (and can contain a script) and will execute script code deviously
# embedded in other file types. The default behaviour as of JIRA 3.12 is to detect when IE would do this and in those
# cases force IE to download the file (or at least to prompt the user). Firefox and Safari users are unaffected by this
# since those browsers comply with the standard regarding Content-Type headers sent by the server.
#
# Three options for attachment downloading policy are available:
#
# secure
# workaround
# insecure
#
# workaround (default) is a reasonably safe option which forces Internet Explorer to download attachments that its
# "mime sniffing" would mistakenly detect it to be an html file. In addition, actual declared html attachments are
# never displayed inline for any browser.
#
# secure is a more paranoid mode which forces all attachments to be downloaded rather than displayed inline. This
# option is designed for high security requirements. Note that users who are prompted may still choose to let IE handle
# the file and may still be prey to an XSS attack.
#
# insecure is an open mode which allows all attachments to be shown inline. If a user decides to add javascript to an
# attachment, this will run in the context of the application and any user who views the attachment is at risk of the
# javascript code being run in their session on their behalf. Only use this option if you know what you are doing and
# have done your own research to determine that this does not undermine your security expectations.
